### Improvments
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the real-time multiplayer feature could not be implemented in this version. However, integrating Socket.io into both the backend and frontend of the game would enable players to engage in a seamless multiplayer experience. Future updates may bring this exciting feature to Famous Landmarks Bingo.
